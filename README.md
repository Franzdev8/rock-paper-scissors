# Rock / Paper / Scissors

The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a game played with a chance of winning against the computer. You can play as many times as you want as there is no score limit.

Rock / Paper / Scissors is a fully responsive JavaScript game that will allow users to enjoy some entertainment for relaxation.

# Features

* **The Header**
    * At the top of the page, the header shows the name of the page (Rock, Paper, Scissors). This is centered in the middle of the page to be easy to read, and itÂ´s the first thing you read as you see the page. It uses a bright red color to contrast with the background.
    * The header clearly shows to the user this page is offering a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

* **The Game Features**
   * Fun images - the use of the images adds to the aesthetics of the site and makes it much more appealing than only using text.

   * The three buttons to click for Rock, Paper and Scissors are easily visible for the user, when they are hovered over with a mouse they enlarge to show the user the specific choice. This is to show the user that they are clicking a certain button.

* **The Game Scores**

    * The scores for Computer and Player are below the game buttons. These stay in the same place at all times and count upwards as the game is played, depending on which player wins the round each time. These are in a clear font with a contrasting background to make it easy to read for the user. The user will benefit from this feature as they can then see what their score is compared to the computer.

* I confirmed that this project is responsive and looks clear to the user. All functions were tested on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device bar on Google Chrome.

* I confirmed that all page contents are readable and clear to see and easy to understand.

* I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools.

# Bugs
* The bug I came across in Javascript was when creating the form functions, Javascript was not reading the code that was written. I seeked support from CI Tutors and I resolved the bug by creating a seperate Javascript file just for the form page, which then fixed this bug.
