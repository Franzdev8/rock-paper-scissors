# Rock / Paper / Scissors

The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a game played with a chance of winning against the computer. You can play as many times as you want as there is no score limit.

Rock / Paper / Scissors is a fully responsive JavaScript game that will allow users to enjoy some entertainment for relaxation.

# Features

* **The Header**
    * At the top of the page, the header shows the name of the page (Rock, Paper, Scissors). This is centered in the middle of the page to be easy to read, and itÂ´s the first thing you read as you see the page. It uses a bright red color to contrast with the background.
    * The header clearly shows to the user this page is offering a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

* **The Game Features**
   * Fun images - the use of the images adds to the aesthetics of the site and makes it much more appealing than only using text.

* **The Game Scores**

    * The scores for Computer and Player are below the game buttons. These stay in the same place at all times and count upwards as the game is played, depending on which player wins the round each time. These are in a clear font with a contrasting background to make it easy to read for the user. The user will benefit from this feature as they can then see what their score is compared to the computer.
